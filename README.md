# Multiple Omics Deep learning models
The goal is to be able to correctly classify each subtype of bladder cancer using all available information (gene expression, methylation, ...)

Write a script indicating the sequence of functions to be called for:
1. Preprocessing the data
2. Applying multiple sources Deep Learning algorithm to the dataset in order to classify
the patients in one of the different classes.
3. Analyzing the results of the different approaches and varying the hyperparameters
using cross validation on genomic data
